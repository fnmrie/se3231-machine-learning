1. Why did you choose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because I frequently play games myself, 
and I was curious to explore whether gaming habits could influence 
academic performance. By analyzing the relationship between different factors 
and students' grades, I aimed to see if a predictive model could be created to 
forecast academic success. Additionally, I selected this dataset because the inputs 
were already in numerical format, making it easier to process and apply machine learning techniques.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

After applying linear regression to the dataset, the results suggest that the model 
can predict students' grades to some extent, but it is not perfectly accurate. In simpler terms, 
while the model does provide some insights, it is not highly accurate in predicting grades. 
This suggests that academic performance is affected by many other factors not included in the dataset, 
such as motivation, study methods, sleep quality, and personal circumstances. If we want a more reliable 
model, we might need to include additional relevant data.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

Linear regression remains highly relevant today, particularly in fields like finance, healthcare, education, 
and business analytics. It serves as a foundational technique for understanding relationships between 
variables and making predictions. Despite the rise of more complex machine learning models, linear regression 
is still widely used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for 
analyzing trends and making data-driven decisions.
