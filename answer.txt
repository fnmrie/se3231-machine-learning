1. Why did you choose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because I frequently play games myself, 
and I was curious to explore whether gaming habits could influence 
academic performance. By analyzing the relationship between different factors 
and students' grades, I aimed to see if a predictive model could be created to 
forecast academic success. Additionally, I selected this dataset because the inputs 
were already in numerical format, making it easier to process and apply machine learning techniques.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

After conducting both Single and Multiple Linear Regression on the dataset, the results suggest
that gaming behavior alone is a weak predictor of student grades. The Single Linear Regression model 
showed that "Playing Hours" had a very low correlation with grades, meaning other factors play a more 
significant role in academic performance. However, when we introduced multiple factors in the Multiple 
Linear Regression model, the predictive accuracy improved significantly. This indicates that a combination 
of personal, school, and family-related factors better explains a student's academic performance rather 
than just gaming habits.

Despite this improvement, the model is still not perfectly accurate suggesting that other unexplored factors 
such as study habits, sleep quality, mental health, and motivation could also be crucial in determining grades. 
We may need to incorporate additional variables and possibly explore more advanced machine learning techniques
to build a more reliable predictive model.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

Linear regression remains highly relevant today, particularly in fields like finance, healthcare, education, 
and business analytics. It serves as a foundational technique for understanding relationships between 
variables and making predictions. Despite the rise of more complex machine learning models, linear regression 
is still widely used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for 
analyzing trends and making data-driven decisions.
